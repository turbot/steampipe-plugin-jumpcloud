# JumpCloud + Steampipe

[JumpCloud](https://jumpcloud.com) provides an open directory platform that helps to unify the technology stack across identity, access, and device management, cost-effectively that doesn't sacrifice security or functionality.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List users with MFA disabled in your JumpCloud organization:

```sql
select
  display_name,
  username,
  email,
  created
from
  jumpcloud_user
where
  mfa is null
  or not (mfa -> 'configured')::boolean;
```

```

All the tables authenticates the requests via a user API key. To locate your API Key:

  # The admin API key to access JumpCloud resources.
  api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```
